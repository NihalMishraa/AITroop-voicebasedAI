# SAHAYAK - Voice-Based AI Customer Care For Visually Impaired

Our project used AI technology to create an accessible tool specifically designed for visually impaired and elderly users. 
By Speech Recognition the required task process through voice commands, AI-driven atsk, and platform optimization, we aim to empower these underserved groups to independently create and share quality video content. This solution addresses a critical gap in digital accessibility and helps bridge the digital divide.
